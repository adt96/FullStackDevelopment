It also provides a history of changes, making it easier to track progress, identify issues, and roll back to previous versions if needed. Additionally, Git fosters better collaboration by allowing team members to merge their contributions seamlessly, ensuring that the development process remains organized and efficient.\n",

        "    A text editor and an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) both serve as tools for writing and editing code, but they differ significantly in terms of functionality and features. A text editor is a lightweight, simple tool primarily focused on text manipulation with minimal distractions, offering basic features like syntax highlighting, search, and simple customization. Popular examples include Sublime Text and Notepad++. In contrast, an IDE is a more feature-rich environment designed specifically for software development, combining a text editor with advanced tools like debugging, code completion, version control integration, and project management. IDEs like Visual Studio, Eclipse, and IntelliJ IDEA streamline the development process by providing comprehensive support for coding, testing, and deployment in a single platform. While text editors are ideal for quick edits or smaller projects, IDEs are better suited for large-scale software development, offering deeper functionality and integration with development workflows.\n",
